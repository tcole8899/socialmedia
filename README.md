# Social Media Project

I am creating this project with the intention of learning how to create a full stack application. Through building this app I hope to gain knowlege on setting up login systems, databases, and backend programming.

The goal of this social media project is to create a simple social media platform that allows users to...
- create an account
- post "tweet" like content
- follow other accounts
- like and save posts from other users

As of right now the login system is built using the following technologies:
- React
- AWS Cognito
  - AWS Amplify
